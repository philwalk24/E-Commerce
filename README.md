## Description

This project uses the ORM model to create a back-end program for an e-commerce buisness. It lets the user use GET POST PUT and DELETE calls in order to interact and change the databases. Right now, only the ones for the Category works. I will resubmit soon after I get this one back.

## Installation

First, you need to clone the github repo. Then, in the same folder as "server.js", you need to run 3 commands: "npm i install" and "npm i mysql2" and "npm install dotenv" and "npm install sequelize". Then you need to seed the schema.sql using mysql and then finally, you run "node seeds/index.js". Then the project can be ran.

## Usage

When its installed, you can run the project by running in the terminal: "node server.js", and then you can use Insomnia to run the different methods like GET POST PUT and DELETE

For this project, I used a little CHATGPT to explain how each datatype is related to one another. I also used the mini project from module 13 to learn how to use module.exports and classes
